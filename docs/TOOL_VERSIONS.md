# Tool Versions (Lock for Reproducibility)

- KiCad: target KiCad 8.x stable (record the exact version you use below)
  - Example: `KiCad 8.0.2 (Windows)`, or `KiCad 8.0.1 (Ubuntu 22.04)`
  - When opening older files, KiCad will upgrade formats automatically on save. Commit upgraded files.
- Python: 3.9+ (checkers use only stdlib)
- Optional: pre-commit 3.x for local hooks
