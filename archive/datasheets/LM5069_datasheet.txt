3 Description
The LM5069 positive hot swap controller provides
intelligent control of the power supply connections
during insertion and removal of circuit cards from a
live system backplane or other hot power sources.
The LM5069 provides in-rush current control to limit
system voltage droop and transients. The current limit
and power dissipation in the external series pass N-
Channel MOSFET are programmable, ensuring
operation within the Safe Operating Area (SOA). The
POWER GOOD output indicates when the output
voltage is within 1.25 V of the input voltage. The input
undervoltage and overvoltage lockout levels and
hysteresis are programmable, as well as the initial
insertion delay time and fault detection time. The
LM5069-1 latches off after a fault detection, while the
LM5069-2 automatically restarts at a fixed duty cycle.
LM5069 is available in a 10-pin VSSOP package.

DESCRIPTION
Current sense input: The voltage across the current sense resistor (Rs) is measured from VIN to this
pin. If the voltage across Rs reaches 55 mV the load current is limited and the fault timer activates.
Positive supply input: A small ceramic bypass capacitor close to this pin is recommended to suppress
transients which occur when the load current is switched off.
Undervoltage lockout: An external resistor divider from the system input voltage sets the undervoltage
turnon threshold. An internal 21-µA current source provides hysteresis. The enable threshold at the pin
is 2.5 V. This pin can also be used for remote shutdown control.
Overvoltage lockout: An external resistor divider from the system input voltage sets the overvoltage
turnoff threshold. An internal 21-µA current source provides hysteresis. The disable threshold at the pin
is 2.5 V.
Circuit ground
Timing capacitor: An external capacitor connected to this pin sets the insertion time delay and the fault
timeout period. The capacitor also sets the restart timing of the LM5069-2.
Power limit set: An external resistor connected to this pin, in conjunction with the current sense resistor
(Rs), sets the maximum power dissipation allowed in the external series pass MOSFET.
Power Good indicator: An open drain output. When the external MOSFET VDS decreases below 1.25 V,
the PGD indicator is active (high). When the external MOSFET VDS increases above 2.5 V the PGD
indicator switches low.
Output feedback: Connect to the output rail (external MOSFET source). Internally used to determine the
MOSFET VDS voltage for power limiting, and to control the PGD indicator.
Gate drive output: Connect to the external MOSFET's gate. This pin's voltage is typically 12 V above
the OUT pin when enabled.

(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings
only, which do not imply functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated under Recommended
Operating Conditions. Exposure to absolute-maximum-rated conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
(2) If Military/Aerospace specified devices are required, please contact the Texas Instruments Sales Office/ Distributors for availability and
specifications.
(3) The GATE pin voltage is typically 12 V above VIN when the LM5069 is enabled. Therefore, the Absolute Maximum Ratings for VIN
(100 V) applies only when the LM5069 is disabled, or for a momentary surge to that voltage because the Absolute Maximum Rating for
the GATE pin is also 100 V.
(4) Select external MOSFET with VGS(th) voltage higher than VOUT during -ve transient. This avoids MOSFET getting turned-ON during -ve
transient.

8 Detailed Description
8.1
Overview
LM5069
SNVS452G-SEPTEMBER 2006-REVISED JAUNUARY 2020
The inline protection functionality of the LM5069 is designed to control the in-rush current to the load upon
insertion of a circuit card into a live backplane or other hot power source, thereby limiting the voltage sag on the
backplane's supply voltage and the dV/dt of the voltage applied to the load. Effects on other circuits in the
system are minimized, preventing possible unintended resets. A controlled shutdown when the circuit card is
removed can also be implemented using the LM5069.
In addition to a programmable current limit, the LM5069 monitors and limits the maximum power dissipation in
the series pass device to maintain operation within the device Safe Operating Area (SOA). Either current limiting
or power limiting for an extended period of time results in the shutdown of the series pass device. In this event,
the LM5069-1 latches off while the LM5069-2 retries an infinite number of times to recover after the fault is
removed. The circuit breaker function quickly switches off the series pass device upon detection of a severe
overcurrent condition. Programmable undervoltage lockout (UVLO) and overvoltage lockout (OVLO) circuits shut
down the LM5069 when the system input voltage is outside the desired operating range.

8.3 Feature Description
8.3.1 Current Limit
www.ti.com
The current limit threshold is reached when the voltage across the sense resistor Rs (VIN to SENSE) reaches
55 mV. In the current limiting condition, the GATE voltage is controlled to limit the current in MOSFET Q1. While
the current limit circuit is active, the fault timer is active as described in Fault Timer and Restart. If the load
current falls below the current limit threshold before the end of the fault timeout period, the LM5069 resumes
normal operation. For proper operation, the Rs resistor value must be no larger than 100 mΩ.
8.3.2 Circuit Breaker
If the load current increases rapidly (for example, the load is short-circuited) the current in the sense resistor (Rs)
may exceed the current limit threshold before the current limit control loop is able to respond. If the current
exceeds twice the current limit threshold (105 mV/Rs), Q1 is quickly switched off by the 230-mA pulldown current
at the GATE pin, and a fault timeout period begins. When the voltage across Rs falls below 105 mV the 230-mA
pulldown current at the GATE pin is switched off, and the gate voltage of Q1 is then determined by the current
limit or the power limit functions. If the TIMER pin reaches 4 V before the current limiting or power limiting
condition ceases, Q1 is switched off by the 2-mA pulldown current at the GATE pin as described in Fault Timer
and Restart.
8.3.3 Power Limit
An important feature of the LM5069 is the MOSFET power limiting. The Power Limit function can be used to
maintain the maximum power dissipation of MOSFET Q1 within the device SOA rating. The LM5069 determines
the power dissipation in Q1 by monitoring its drain-source voltage (SENSE to OUT), and the drain current
through the sense resistor (VIN to SENSE). The product of the current and voltage is compared to the power
limit threshold programmed by the resistor at the PWR pin. If the power dissipation reaches the limiting threshold,
the GATE voltage is modulated to reduce the current in Q1. While the power limiting circuit is active, the fault
timer is active as described in Fault Timer and Restart.
8.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)
The series pass MOSFET (Q1) is enabled when the input supply voltage (Vsys) is within the operating range
defined by the programmable undervoltage lockout (UVLO) and overvoltage lockout (OVLO) levels. Typically the
UVLO level at Vsys is set with a resistor divider (R1-R3) as shown in Figure 30. When Vsys is below the UVLO
level, the internal 21-µA current source at UVLO is enabled, the current source at OVLO is off, and Q1 is held off
by
the
2-mA pulldown current at the GATE pin. As Vsys is increased, raising the voltage at UVLO above 2.5 V, the
21-µA current source at UVLO is switched off, increasing the voltage at UVLO, providing hysteresis for this
threshold. With the UVLO pin above 2.5 V, Q1 is switched on by the 16-μΑ current source at the GATE pin if the
insertion time delay has expired (Figure 22). See Application and Implementation for a procedure to calculate the
values of the threshold setting resistors (R1-R3). The minimum possible UVLO level at Vsys can be set by
connecting the UVLO pin to VIN. In this case Q1 is enabled when the VIN voltage reaches the POREN threshold.
8.3.5 Overvoltage Lockout (OVLO)
The series pass MOSFET (Q1) is enabled when the input supply voltage (Vsys) is within the operating range
defined by the programmable undervoltage lockout (UVLO) and overvoltage lockout (OVLO) levels. If Vsys raises
the OVLO pin voltage above 2.5 V, Q1 is switched off by the 2-mA pulldown current at the GATE pin, denying
power to the load. When the OVLO pin is above 2.5 V, the internal 21-µA current source at OVLO is switched on,
raising the voltage at OVLO to provide threshold hysteresis. When Vsys is reduced below the OVLO level Q1 is
enabled. See Application and Implementation for a procedure to calculate the threshold setting resistor values.
8.3.6 Power Good Pin
During turnon, the Power Good pin (PGD) is high until the voltage at VIN increases above ≈ 5 V. PGD then
switches low, remaining low as the VIN voltage increases. When the voltage at OUT increases to within 1.25 V of
the SENSE pin (VDS <1.25 V), PGD switches high. PGD switches low if the VDs of Q1 increases above 2.5 V. A
pullup resistor is required at PGD as shown in Figure 20. The pullup voltage (VPGD) can be as high as 80 V, with
transient capability to 100 V, and can be higher or lower than the voltages at VIN and OUT.

8.4 Device Functional Modes
The LM5069 hot swap controller has a power up sequence which can be broken down into 3x distinct sections:
Insertion Time, In-Rush Limiting, and Normal Operation. Once the device reaches normal operation, the GATE
and TIMER behavior depends on whether a fault condition is present or not on the output.
8.4.1 Power Up Sequence
The VIN operating range of the LM5069 is 9 V to 80 V, with a transient capability to 100 V. See Functional Block
Diagram and Figure 22, as the voltage at VIN initially increases, the external N-channel MOSFET (Q1) is held off
by an internal 230-mA pulldown current at the GATE pin. The strong pulldown current at the GATE pin prevents
an inadvertent turnon as the MOSFET's gate-to-drain (Miller) capacitance is charged. Additionally, the TIMER pin
is initially held at ground. When the VIN voltage reaches the PORIT threshold (7.6 V) the insertion time begins.
During the insertion time, the capacitor at the TIMER pin (CT) is charged by a 5.5-µA current source, and Q1 is
held off by a 2-mA pulldown current at the GATE pin regardless of the VIN voltage. The insertion time delay
allows ringing and transients at VIN to settle before Q1 can be enabled. The insertion time ends when the TIMER
pin voltage reaches 4 V. C† is then quickly discharged by an internal 1.5-mA pulldown current. After the insertion
time, the LM5069 control circuitry is enabled when VIN reaches the POREN threshold (8.4 V). The GATE pin then
switches on Q1 when Vsys exceeds the UVLO threshold (UVLO pin >2.5 V). If Vsys is above the UVLO threshold
at the end of the insertion time, Q1 switches on at that time. The GATE pin charge pump sources 16 µA to
charge Q1's gate capacitance. The maximum gate-to-source voltage of Q1 is limited by an internal 12-V Zener
diode.

As the voltage at the OUT pin increases, the LM5069 monitors the drain current and power dissipation of
MOSFET Q1. In-rush current limiting and/or power limiting circuits actively control the current delivered to the
load. During the in-rush limiting interval (t2 in Figure 22) an internal 85-µA fault timer current source charges Ст.
If Q1's power dissipation and the input current reduce below their respective limiting thresholds before the
TIMER pin reaches 4 V, the 85-µA current source is switched off, and C₁ is discharged by the internal 2.5-μΑ
current sink (t3 in Figure 22). The in-rush limiting interval is complete when the voltage at the OUT pin increases
to within 1.25 V of the input voltage (Vsys), and the PGD pin switches high.
If the TIMER pin voltage reaches 4 V before in-rush current limiting or power limiting ceases (during t2), a fault is
declared and Q1 is turned off. See Fault Timer and Restart for a complete description of the fault mode.

8.4.2 Gate Control
A charge pump provides internal bias voltage above the output voltage (OUT pin) to enhance the N-Channel
MOSFET's gate. The gate-to-source voltage is limited by an internal 12-V Zener diode. During normal operating
conditions (t3 in Figure 22) the gate of Q1 is held charged by an internal 16-µA current source to approximately
12 V above OUT. If the maximum VGs rating of Q1 is less than 12 V, an external Zener diode of lower voltage
must be added between the GATE and OUT pins. The external Zener diode must have a forward current rating
of at least 250 mA.
When the system voltage is initially applied, the GATE pin is held low by a 230-mA pulldown current. This helps
prevent an inadvertent turnon of the MOSFET through its drain-gate capacitance as the applied system voltage
increases.
During the insertion time (t1 in Figure 22) the GATE pin is held low by a 2-mA pulldown current. This maintains
Q1 in the off-state until the end of t1, regardless of the voltage at VIN or UVLO.
Following the insertion time, during t2 in Figure 22, the gate voltage of Q1 is modulated to keep the current or
power dissipation level from exceeding the programmed levels. While in the current or power limiting mode the
TIMER pin capacitor is charging. If the current and power limiting cease before the TIMER pin reaches 4 V the
TIMER pin capacitor then discharges, and the circuit enters normal operation.

If the in-rush limiting condition persists such that the TIMER pin reached 4 V during t2, the GATE pin is then
pulled low by the 2-mA pulldown current. The GATE pin is then held low until either a power-up sequence is
initiated (LM5069-1), or until the end of the restart sequence (LM5069-2). See Fault Timer and Restart.
If the system input voltage falls below the UVLO threshold, or rises above the OVLO threshold, the GATE pin is

8.4.3 Fault Timer and Restart
When the current limit or power limit threshold is reached during turnon or as a result of a fault condition, the
gate-to-source voltage of Q1 is modulated to regulate the load current and power dissipation. When either
limiting function is activated, an 85-µA fault timer current source charges the external capacitor (CT) at the
TIMER pin as shown in Figure 25 (fault timeout period). If the fault condition subsides during the fault timeout
period before the TIMER pin reaches 4 V, the LM5069 returns to the normal operating mode and CT is
discharged by the 2.5-µA current sink. If the TIMER pin reaches 4 V during the fault timeout period, Q1 is
switched off by a 2-mA pulldown current at the GATE pin. The subsequent restart procedure then depends on
which version of the LM5069 is in use.
The LM5069-1 latches the GATE pin low at the end of the fault timeout period. C₁ is then discharged to ground
by the 2.5-µA fault current sink. The GATE pin is held low by the 2-mA pulldown current until a power-up
sequence is externally initiated by cycling the input voltage (Vsys), or momentarily pulling the UVLO pin below
2.5 V with an open-collector or open-drain device as shown in Figure 24. The voltage at the TIMER pin must be
<0.3 V for the restart procedure to be effective.

The LM5069-2 provides an automatic restart sequence which consists of the TIMER pin cycling between 4 V and
1.25 V seven times after the fault timeout period, as shown in Figure 25. The period of each cycle is determined
by the 85-µA charging current, and the 2.5-µA discharge current, and the value of the capacitor C†. When the
TIMER pin reaches 0.3 V during the eighth high-to-low ramp, the 16-µA current source at the GATE pin turns on
Q1. If the fault condition is still present, the fault timeout period and the restart cycle repeat.

9 Application and Implementation
NOTE
Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component
specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. Tl's customers are
responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes. Customers should
validate and test their design implementation to confirm system functionality.
9.1 Application Information
The LM5069 is a hot swap controller which is used to manage inrush current and protect in case of faults. When
designing a hot swap, three key scenarios must be considered:
•
•
•
Start-up
Output of a hot swap is shorted to ground when the hot swap is on. This is often referred to as a hot-short.
Powering up a board when the output and ground are shorted. This is usually called a start-into-short.
All of these scenarios place a lot of stress on the hot swap MOSFET and thus special care is required when
designing the hot swap circuit to keep the MOSFET within its SOA (Safe Operating Area). Detailed design
examples are provided in the following sections. Solving all of the equations by hand is cumbersome and can
result in errors. Instead, TI recommends using the LM5069 Design Calculator provided on the product page.

9.2.1.1 Design Requirements
Table 1 summarizes the design parameters that must be known before designing a hot swap circuit. When
charging the output capacitor through the hot swap MOSFET, the FET's total energy dissipation equals the total
energy stored in the output capacitor (12CV2). Thus, both the input voltage and output capacitance determine the
stress experienced by the MOSFET. The maximum load current drives the current limit and sense resistor
selection. In addition, the maximum load current, maximum ambient temperature, and the thermal properties of

the PCB (ROCA) drive the selection of the MOSFET RDSON and the number of MOSFETs used. ROCA is a strong
function of the layout and the amount of copper that is connected to the drain of the MOSFET. Note that the
drain is not electrically connected to the ground plane and thus the ground plane cannot be used to help with
heat dissipation. For this design example RCA = 30°C/W is used, which is similar to the LM5069 EVM. It's a
good practice to measure the ROCA of a given design after the physical PCBs are available.
Finally, it's important to understand what test conditions the hot swap must pass. In general, a hot swap is
designed to pass both a Hot-Short and a Start into a Short. Also, TI recommends keeping the load OFF until the
hot swap is fully powered up. Starting the load early causes unnecessary stress on the MOSFET and could lead
to MOSFET failures or a failure to start-up.

The LM5069 monitors the current in the external MOSFET (Q1) by measuring the voltage across the sense
resistor (RS), connected from VIN to SENSE. When the voltage difference across the VIN and SENSE pins
(VCL) is greater than 55 mV (typical), the LM5069 begins modulating the MOSFET gate. Size Rsns for maximum
or minimum VCL for applications that require ensured shutoff or ensured conduction. Rsns is sized to exhibit

Figure 29.

error. Finally, if the resistor divider approach is used, compute the effective sense resistance (RSNS, EFF) using
Equation 3 and use that in all equations instead of RSNS·

Note that for many applications, a precise current limit may not be required. In that case, it's simpler to pick the

9.2.1.2.2 Selecting the Hot Swap FET(s)
It is critical to select the correct MOSFET for a hot swap design. The device must meet the following
requirements:
•
•
•
The VDS rating must be sufficient to handle the maximum system voltage along with any ringing caused by
transients.
The SOA of the FET must be sufficient to handle all usage cases: start-up, hot-short, start into short.
RDSON must be sufficiently low to maintain the junction and case temperature below the maximum rating of
the FET. In fact, TI recommends keeping the steady state FET temperature below 125°C to allow margin to
handle transients.
Maximum continuous current rating must be above the maximum load current and the pulsed drain current
must be greater than the current threshold of the circuit breaker. Most MOSFETs that pass the first three
requirements also pass these two.
For this design the SUM40N15-38 was selected. After selecting the MOSFET, the maximum steady state case
temperature can be computed as Equation 4.

Note that the RDSON is a strong function of junction temperature, which for most MOSFETs is close to the case
temperature. A few iterations of the above equations may be necessary to converge on the final RDSON and
TC, MAX value. According to the CSD19536KTT datasheet, its RDSON is approximately 1.2x at 65°C. Equation 5
uses this RDSON value to compute the TC,MAX·

This maximum steady state case temperature does not indicate that a second MOSFET may be required to
reduce and distribute power dissipation during normal operation.

Iterate until the computed TC.MAX is using two parallel MOSFETs is less than to the junction temperature

9.2.1.2.3 Select Power Limit
In general, a lower-power limit setting is preferred to reduce the stress on the MOSFET. However, when the
LM5069 is set to a very low power limit setting, it has to regulate the FET current and hence the voltage across
the sense resistor (VsNs) to a very low value. VsNs can be computed as shown in Equation 7.

PLIM X R SNS

To avoid significant degradation of the power limiting accuracy, a Vsns of less than 5 mV is not recommended.
Based on this requirement the minimum allowed power limit can be computed in Equation 8.

Note that the minimum RPWR would occur when VDS = VIN,MAX. We can then compute the minimum RPWR with

(10)
To obtain the smallest accurate power limit, the next largest available resistor must be selected. In this case a
15.8-ΚΩ resistor was chosen, which sets a 39.23-W power limit.
9.2.1.2.4 Set Fault Timer
The fault timer runs when the hot swap is in power limit or current limit, which is the case during start-up. Thus
the timer has to be sized large enough to prevent a time-out during start-up. If the part starts directly into current
limit (ILIM × VDS < PLIM) the maximum start time can be computed with Equation 11.

Note that the above start-time assumes constant, typical current limit and power limit values. The actual startup
time is slightly longer, as the power limit is a function of Vds and decreases as the output voltage increases. To
ensure that the timer never times out during start-up, TI recommends setting the minimum fault time (tfit) to be
greater than the start time (tstart) by adding an additional margin of 50% of the fault time. This accounts for the
variation in power limit, timer current, and timer capacitance. Thus CTIMER can be computed with Equation 13.

(14)
This is the typical time that the LM5069 shuts off the CSD19536KTT MOSFET.
9.2.1.2.5 Check MOSFET SOA
Once the power limit and fault timer are chosen, it's critical to check that the FET stays within its SOA during all
test conditions. During a Hot-Short, the circuit breaker trips and the LM5069 restarts into power limit until the
timer runs out. In the worst case, the MOSFET's Vps equals Vin,MAX, IDs equals PLIM / VIN,MAX and the stress
event lasts for tfit. For this design example, the MOSFET has 30 V, 1.25 A across it for 7.06 ms.
Based on the SOA of the CSD19536KTT, it can handle 30 V, 9 A for 10 ms and it can handle 30 V, 20 A for
1 ms. The SOA for 7.06 ms can be extrapolated by approximating SOA versus time as a power function as
shown Equation 15 through Equation 18.

Note that the SOA of a MOSFET is specified at a case temperature of 25°C, while the case temperature can be
much hotter during a hot-short. The SOA must be derated based on TC,MAX using Equation 19.

Based on this calculation the MOSFET can handle 7.55 A, 30 V for 7.06 ms at elevated case temperature, and is
required to handle 1.25 A during a hot-short. This means the MOSFET is not at risk of getting damaged during a
hot-short. In general, TI recommends for the MOSFET to be able to handle a minimum of 1.3× more power than
what is required during a hot-short to provide margin to cover the variance of the power limit and fault time.
9.2.1.2.6 Set Undervoltage and Overvoltage Threshold
By programming the UVLO and OVLO thresholds the LM5069 enables the series pass device (Q1) when the
input supply voltage (Vsys) is within the desired operational range. If Vsys is below the UVLO threshold, or above
the OVLO threshold, Q1 is switched off, denying power to the load. Hysteresis is provided for each threshold.
9.2.1.2.6.1 Option A
The configuration shown in Figure 30 requires three resistors (R1-R3) to set the thresholds.

The procedure to calculate the resistor values is as follows:

2. Choose the upper OVLO threshold (VOVH).
3. The lower OVLO threshold (VOVL) cannot be chosen in advance in this case, but is determined after the
values for R1-R3 are determined. If VOVL must be accurately defined in addition to the other three thresholds,
see Option B below.

9.2.1.2.7 Input and Output Protection
LM5069
SNVS452G-SEPTEMBER 2006-REVISED JAUNUARY 2020
Proper operation of the LM5069 hot swap circuit requires a voltage clamping element present on the supply side
of the connector into which the hot swap circuit is plugged in. A TVS is ideal, as depicted in Figure 27. The TVS
is necessary to absorb the voltage transient generated whenever the hot swap circuit shuts off the load current.
This effect is the most severe during a hot-short when a large current is suddenly interrupted when the FET
shuts off. The TVS must be chosen to have minimal leakage current at VIN,MAX and to clamp the voltage to under
30 V during hot-short events. For many high-power applications intended to clamp at 30 V, SMBJ30A-13-F is a
good choice.
9.2.1.2.8 Final Schematic and Component Values
Figure 27 shows the schematic used to implement the requirements described in the previous section. In
addition, Table 2 below provides the final component values that were used to meet the design requirements for
a 12-V, 40-A hot swap design. The Application Curves are based on these component values.

10 Power Supply Recommendations
In general, the LM5069 behavior is more reliable if it is supplied from a very regulated power supply. However,
high-frequency transients on a backplane are not uncommon due to adjacent card insertions or faults. If this is
expected in the end system, TI recommends placing a 1-µF ceramic capacitor to ground close to the drain of the
hot swap MOSFET. This reduces the common mode voltage seen by VIN and SENSE. Additional filtering may
be necessary to avoid nuisance trips.

11.1 Layout Guidelines
11.1.1 PC Board Guidelines
The following guidelines must be followed when designing the PC board for the LM5069:
•
•
www.ti.com
Place the LM5069 close to the board's input connector to minimize trace inductance from the connector to the
FET.
Note that special care must be taken when placing the bypass capacitor for the VIN pin. During hot shorts,
there is a very large dV/dt on input voltage after the MOSFET turns off. If the bypass capacitor is placed right
next to the pin and the trace from Rsns to the pin is long, an LC filter is formed. As a result, a large differential
voltage can develop between VIN and SENSE. To avoid this, place the bypass capacitor close to Rsns
instead of the VIN pin.

X
Trace
Inductance
•
•
•
Figure 43. Layout Trace Inductance
The sense resistor (Rs) must be close to the LM5069, and connected to it using the Kelvin techniques shown
in Figure 46.
The high current path from the board's input to the load (via Q1), and the return path, must be parallel and
close to each other to minimize loop inductance.
The ground connection for the various components around the LM5069 must be connected directly to each
other, and to the LM5069's GND pin, and then connected to the system ground at one point. Do not connect
the various component grounds to each other through the high current ground line.
Provide adequate heat sinking for the series pass device (Q1) to help reduce stresses during turnon and
turnoff.
The board's edge connector can be designed to shut off the LM5069 as the board is removed, before the
supply voltage is disconnected from the LM5069. In Figure 45 the voltage at the UVLO pin goes to ground
before Vsys is removed from the LM5069 due to the shorter edge connector pin. When the board is inserted
into the edge connector, the system voltage is applied to the LM5069's VIN pin before the UVLO voltage is
taken high.
11.1.2 System Considerations
A) Continued proper operation of the LM5069 hot swap circuit requires capacitance be present on the supply
side of the connector into which the hot swap circuit is plugged in, as depicted in Figure 44. The capacitor in the
Live Backplane section is necessary to absorb the transient generated whenever the hot swap circuit shuts off
the load current. If the capacitance is not present, inductance in the supply lines generate a voltage transient at
shut-off which can exceed the absolute maximum rating of the LM5069, resulting in its destruction.
B) If the load powered via the LM5069 hot swap circuit has inductive characteristics, a diode is required across
the LM5069's output. The diode provides a recirculating path for the load's current when the LM5069 shuts off
that current. Adding the diode prevents possible damage to the LM5069 as the OUT pin is taken below ground
by the inductive load at shutoff. See Figure 44.

(1) Status: For more details on status, see our product life cycle.
(2) Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance,
reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional
waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.
(3) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.
(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum
column width.
(5) MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown.
Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.
(6) Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.
Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two
combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
