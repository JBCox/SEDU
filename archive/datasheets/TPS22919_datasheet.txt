3 Description
The TPS22919 device is a small, single channel load
switch with controlled slew rate. The device contains
an N-channel MOSFET that can operate over an
input voltage range of 1.6 V to 5.5 V and can support
a maximum continuous current of 1.5 A.
The switch ON state is controlled by a digital input
that is capable of interfacing directly with low-voltage
control signals. When power is first applied, a Smart
Pull Down is used to keep the ON pin from floating
until system sequencing is complete. Once the pin is
deliberately driven High (>VIH), the Smart Pull Down
will be disconnected to prevent unnecessary power
loss.
The TPS22919 load switch is also self-protected,
meaning that it will protect itself from short circuit
events on the output of the device. It also has thermal
shutdown to prevent any damage from overheating.
TPS22919 is available in a standard SC-70 package
characterized for operation over a junction
temperature range of -40°C to 125°C.

8 Detailed Description
8.1 Overview
The TPS22919 device is a 5.5-V, 1.5-A load switch in a 6-pin SOT-23 package. To reduce voltage drop for low
voltage and high current rails, the device implements a low resistance N-channel MOSFET which reduces the
drop out voltage across the device.
The TPS22919 device has a slow slew rate which helps reduce or eliminate power supply droop because of
large inrush currents. Furthermore, the device features a QOD pin, which allows the configuration of the
discharge rate of VOUT once the switch is disabled. During shutdown, the device has very low leakage currents,
thereby reducing unnecessary leakages for downstream modules during standby. Integrated control logic, driver,
charge pump, and output discharge FET eliminates the need for any external components which reduces
solution size and bill of materials (BOM) count.
The TPS22919 load switch is also self-protected, meaning that it will protect itself from short circuit events on the
output of the device. It also has thermal shutdown to prevent any damage from overheating.

8.3 Feature Description
8.3.1 On and Off Control
The ON pin controls the state of the switch. The ON pin is compatible with standard GPIO logic threshold so it
can be used in a wide variety of applications. When power is first applied to VIN, a Smart Pull Down is used to
keep the ON pin from floating until the system sequencing is complete. Once the ON pin is deliberately driven
high (≥VIH), the Smart Pull Down is disconnected to prevent unnecessary power loss. See Table 1 when the ON
Pin Smart Pull Down is active.

8.3.2 Output Short Circuit Protection (Isc)
The device will limit current to the output in case of output shorts. When a short occurs, the large VIN to VOUT
voltage drop causes the switch to limit the output current (Isc) within (tsc). When the output is below the hard
short threshold (Vsc), a lower limit is used to minimize the power dissipation while the fault is present. The device
will continue to limit the current until it reaches its thermal shutdown temperature. At this time, the device will turn
off until its temperature has lowered by the thermal hysteresis (35°C typical) before turning on again.

8.3.3 Fall Time (tFALL) and Quick Output Discharge (QOD)
•
•
The TPS22919 device includes a QOD pin that can be configured in one of three ways:
QOD pin shorted to VOUT pin. Using this method, the discharge rate after the switch becomes disabled is
controlled with the value of the internal resistance QOD (RPD,QOD).
QOD pin connected to VOUT pin using an external resistor RQOD. After the switch becomes disabled, the
discharge rate is controlled by the value of the total discharge resistance. To adjust the total discharge
resistance, Equation 1 can be used:
RDIS = RPD,QOD + RQOD
Where:
RDIS = Total output discharge resistance (Ω)

Product Folder Links: TPS22919
RPD,QOD = Internal pulldown resistance (Ω)
•
RQOD = External resistance placed between the VOUT and QOD pins (Ω)
(1)
QOD pin is unused and left floating. Using this method, there will be no quick output discharge functionality,
and the output will remain floating after the switch is disabled.
The fall times of the device depend on many factors including the total discharge resistance (RDIS) and the output
capacitance (C₁). To calculate the approximate fall time of VOUT use Equation 2.
FALL = 2.2 × (RDIS || RL) × CL
Where:
tFALL = Output Fall Time from 90% to 10% (μς)
RDIS = Total QOD + RQOD Resistance (Ω)
R₁ = Output Load Resistance (Ω)
•
C₁ = Output Load Capacitance (µF)
(2)
8.3.3.1 QOD When System Power is Removed
The adjustable QOD can be used to control the power down sequencing of a system even when the system
power supply is removed. When the power is removed, the input capacitor discharges at VIN. Past a certain VIN
level, the strength of the RPD will be reduced. If there is still remaining charge on the output capacitor, this will
result in longer fall times. For further information regarding this condition, see the Setting Fall Time for Shutdown
Power Sequencing section.

9 Application and Implementation
NOTE
Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component
specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. Tl's customers are
responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes. Customers should
validate and test their design implementation to confirm system functionality.
9.1 Application Information
This section highlights some of the design considerations when implementing this device in various applications.

9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure
9.2.2.1 Limiting Inrush Current
Use Equation 3 to find the maximum slew rate value to limit inrush current for a given capacitance:
(Slew Rate) = IRUSH ÷ CL
where
IINRUSH = maximum acceptable inrush current (mA)
C₁ = capacitance on VOUT (μF)
Slew Rate = Output Slew Rate during turn on (mV/µs)
(3)
Based on Equation 3, the required slew rate to limit the inrush current to 150 mA is 3.2 mV/μs. The TPS22919
has a slew rate of 2.3 mV/µs, so the inrush current will be below 150 mA.
9.2.2.2 Setting Fall Time for Shutdown Power Sequencing
Microcontrollers and processors often have a specific shutdown sequence in which power must be removed.
Using the adjustable Quick Output Discharge function of the TPS22919 device, adding a load switch to each
power rail can be used to manage the power down sequencing. To determine the QOD values for each load
switch, first confirm the power down order of the device you wish to power sequence. Be sure to check if there
are voltage or timing margins that must be maintained during power down.
Once the required fall time is determined, the maximum external discharge resistance (RDIS) value can be found
using Equation 2:
FALL = 2.2 × (RDIS || RL) × CL
RDIS = 630 Ω
(4)
(5)
Equation 1 can then be used to calculate the Roop resistance needed to achieve a particular discharge value:
RDIS = QOD + RQOD
(6)
RQOD = 600 Ω
(7)
To ensure a fall time greater than, choose an RQOD value greater than 600 Ω.

10 Power Supply Recommendations
The device is designed to operate with a VIN range of 1.6 V to 5.5 V. The VIN power supply must be well
regulated and placed as close to the device terminal as possible. The power supply must be able to withstand all
transient load current steps. In most situations, using an input capacitance (CIN) of 1 µF is sufficient to prevent
the supply voltage from dipping when the switch is turned on. In cases where the power supply is slow to
respond to a large transient current or large load current step, additional bulk capacitance may be required on
the input.

11 Layout
11.1 Layout Guidelines
For best performance, all traces must be as short as possible. To be most effective, the input and output
capacitors must be placed close to the device to minimize the effects that parasitic trace inductances may have
on normal operation. Using wide traces for VIN, VOUT, and GND helps minimize the parasitic electrical effects.

11.3 Thermal Considerations
Figure 32. Recommended Board Layout
The maximum IC junction temperature should be restricted to 125°C under normal operating conditions. To
calculate the maximum allowable dissipation, PD(max) for a given output current and ambient temperature, use
Equation 8:
PD(MAX) =
where
•
TJ(MAX) - TA
OJA
PD(MAX) = maximum allowable power dissipation
TJ(MAX) = maximum allowable junction temperature (125°C for the TPS22919 devices)
TA = ambient temperature of the device
OJA = junction to air thermal impedance. Refer to the Thermal Parameters table. This parameter is highly
dependent upon board layout.
