## Directory Overview

This directory contains documentation and resources for the **SEDU Positive-Feed Drill**, a handheld aviation tool. The project is based on an ESP32-C6 microcontroller, a VESC motor controller, and an ElectroCraft RPX32 BLDC motor. The files describe the system's electrical wiring, planned functionality, and hardware components.

## Key Files

*   **`SEDU_PFD_Wiring_and_Function_v0.1.md`**: The main document detailing the project. It includes:
    *   A system overview with a block diagram.
    *   Detailed wiring information for power, communications, and I/O.
    *   A description of the planned functional behavior and a state machine sketch.
    *   A bring-up checklist and risk mitigation strategies.

*   **`Electrocraft - RPX32-DataSheet-US.pdf`**: The datasheet for the ElectroCraft RPX32-150 BLDC motor used in the project.

*   **Image Files (`.jpg`)**: Temporary image files, likely related to the project hardware or documentation.

## Usage

The contents of this directory are for understanding, building, and developing the SEDU Positive-Feed Drill. The primary document, `SEDU_PFD_Wiring_and_Function_v0.1.md`, should be consulted for all aspects of the project's hardware and intended operation.
